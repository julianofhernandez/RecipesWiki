Pour this into a sterilized container with 0.2 L of previously fermented kombucha tea. This will lower the pH. Cover the container with a breathable fabric that will not allow insects such as Drosophila fruit flies to contaminate the kombucha. The tea is left to ferment for a period of 10 to 14 days at 18 C to 26 C. Over this period a new scoby will form which can be used for the next batch. The remaining kombucha is strained and bottled for a secondary fermentation for a few days or stored at 4 C.","title":"Kombucha"},{"location":"recipes/kombucha/#kombucha","text":"1 L water 50 g sugar 5 g of tea 24 g of scoby 0.2 L kombucha tea Boil 1 L of non-chlorinated water and dissolve 50 g of sugar in it.
