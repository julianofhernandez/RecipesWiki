Pour this into a sterilized container with 0.2 L of previously fermented kombucha tea. This will lower the pH. Cover the container with a breathable fabric or coffee filter that will not allow insects such as Drosophila fruit flies to contaminate the kombucha. The tea is left to ferment for a period of 10 to 14 days at 18 C to 26 C. Over this period a new scoby will form which can be used for the next batch. The remaining kombucha is strained and bottled for a secondary fermentation for a few days or stored at 4 C. 2F Ingredients 1F kombucha Juice or fruit Ginger (optional) Steps Strain 1F kombucha first to remove particles and other unwanted material.
