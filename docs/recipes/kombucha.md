# Kombucha

- 1 L water
- 50 g sugar
- 5 g of tea
- 24 g of scoby
- 0.2 L kombucha tea

Boil 1 L of non-chlorinated water and dissolve 50 g of sugar in it. Next, add 5 g of tea leaves to the water and let them steep for 5 minutes then discard them. Cool the sweetened tea to 20 C and add 24 g of scoby culture. Pour this into a sterilized container with 0.2 L of previously fermented kombucha tea. This will lower the pH. Cover the container with a breathable fabric that will not allow insects such as *Drosophila* fruit flies to contaminate the kombucha. The tea is left to ferment for a period of 10 to 14 days at 18 C to 26 C. Over this period a new scoby will form which can be used for the next batch. The remaining kombucha is strained and bottled for a secondary fermentation for a few days or stored at 4 C.
