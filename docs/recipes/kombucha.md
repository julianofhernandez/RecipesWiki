# Kombucha

## 1F
**Ingredients**

- 1 L water
- 50 g sugar
- 5 g of tea
- 24 g of scoby
- 0.2 L kombucha tea

**Steps**

Boil 1 L of non-chlorinated water and dissolve 50 g of sugar in it. Next, add 5 g of tea leaves to the water and let them steep for 5 minutes then discard them. Cool the sweetened tea to 20 C and add 24 g of scoby culture. Pour this into a sterilized container with 0.2 L of previously fermented kombucha tea. This will lower the pH. Cover the container with a breathable fabric or coffee filter that will not allow insects such as *Drosophila* fruit flies to contaminate the kombucha. The tea is left to ferment for a period of 10 to 14 days at 18 C to 26 C. Over this period a new scoby will form which can be used for the next batch. The remaining kombucha is strained and bottled for a secondary fermentation for a few days or stored at 4 C.

## 2F

**Ingredients**

- 1F kombucha
- Juice or fruit
- Ginger (optional)

**Steps**

Strain 1F kombucha first to remove particles and other unwanted material. Fill jars 1/8 way full of juice or cut up fruit and fill the rest with kombucha. Close these and store 2-3 days in a 20 C to 25 C area. For more fizz ginger can be used.
