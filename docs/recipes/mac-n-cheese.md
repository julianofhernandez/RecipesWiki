# Mac & Cheese

**Ingredients**

- 450g dried elbow pasta
- 1 stick of butter
- 1/2 cup all purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cups whole milk
- 2 1/2 cups half and half
- 6 cups grated medium sharp cheddar cheese divided
- 1/2 tablespoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon paprika

**Steps**

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and grease a 3 qt baking dish (9x13"). Set aside.
2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
3. Melt butter in a large saucepan over MED heat. Sprinkle in flour and whisk to combine. Mixture will look like very wet sand. Cook for approximately 1 minute, whisking often. Slowly pour in the milk/half and half, while whisking constantly, until smooth.
4. Stir in spices and 3 cups of the cheese.
5. In a large mixing bowl, combine drained pasta with cheese sauce, stirring to combine fully. Pour half of the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish.  Top with 1 1/2 cups of grated cheeses, then top that with the remaining pasta mixture.
6. Sprinkle the top with the last 1 1/2 cups of cheese and bake for 15 minutes, then switch to broil until golden brown.
